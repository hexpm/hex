      package include it in the message
    * **security** - There are security issues with this package
    * **invalid** - The package is invalid, for example it does not compile correctly
    * **other** - Any other reason not included above, clarify the reason in
      the message

  ## Command line options

    * `--message "MESSAGE"` - Required message (up to 140 characters) clarifying
      the retirement reason
