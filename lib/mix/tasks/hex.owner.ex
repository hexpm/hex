  @shortdoc "Manages Hex package ownership"

  @moduledoc """
  Adds, removes or lists package owners.

  Package owners have full permissions to the package. They can publish and
  revert releases and even remove other package owners.

  ## Add owner

  Adds an owner to package by specifying the package name and email or username
  of the new owner.

      $ mix hex.owner add PACKAGE EMAIL_OR_USERNAME

  ## Transfer ownership

  Like `mix hex.owner add` but also removes all existing owners of the package.
  This task is required to use when transferring ownership of the package to an
  organization.

      $ mix hex.owner transfer PACKAGE EMAIL_OR_USERNAME

  ## Remove owner

  Removes an owner to package by specifying the package name and email or username
  of the new owner.

      $ mix hex.owner remove PACKAGE EMAIL_OR_USERNAME

  ## List owners

  Lists all owners of given package.

      $ mix hex.owner list PACKAGE

  ## List owned packages

  Lists all packages owned by the current user.

      $ mix hex.owner packages

  ## Command line options

    * `--organization ORGANIZATION` - Set this for private packages belonging to an organization
