A new check has been introduced that requires the latest registry record version, if you are using a repository or mirror that has not been updated yet you can disable this check by setting the environment variable `HEX_NO_VERIFY_REPO_ORIGIN=1`. Further clarification of this issue will come at a later stage.

## v0.18.1 (2018-07-06)

### Bug fixes

* Fix normalization of repo paths when authenticating organization

## v0.18.0 (2018-07-05)

### API keys

When authenticating with `mix hex.user auth` two API keys are generated instead of single one. One key is unencrypted with read access and the other is encrypted with your local password and has full read/write access to the API. Now commands that don't make any changes will not require a password.

Additionally, we generate a single key that gives access to all your organization repositories, instead of one key for each repository. It also has the added benefit that you don't have to reauthenticate if you are added to a new organization.

We have also added support for keys owned directly by an organization instead of a specific user, these keys can be accessed through `mix hex.organization`. This is useful when generating keys for a CI environment, previously when personal keys were used, a person leaving an organization or revoking the key could negatively affect CI workflow.

### Improvements to continuous integration workflows

The `HEX_API_KEY` environment variable has been introduced to be able run commands that require an authentication without having to authenticate manually with `mix hex.user auth` which has user input prompts. The key set with `HEX_API_KEY` can be generated with `mix hex.user key generate` or `mix hex.organization key ORGANIZATION generate`. It also makes it possible to run commands such as `mix hex.publish` without being prompted for a password.

By passing the `--yes` flag to `mix hex.publish` you can publish your package (together with `HEX_API_KEY`) without any confirmation prompts. This allows you to publish your package as part of your CI build process.

### Ignoring `:maintainers` field

In previous Hex versions we required `:maintainers` key to be present when publishing package. At the same time, on hex.pm we are also showing package owners (controlled by the `mix hex.owner` task). It was confusing to show both maintainers and owners and figure out which really control the package, so we've dropped showing maintainers on hex.pm and the field will no longer be added to package's metadata.

If maintainers field was used to give credit to current and/or past contributors we encourage to mention that in project's README instead.

### Enhancements

* Add `--yes` flag to `hex.publish` for publishing without any confirmation prompts
* Add `HEX_API_KEY` environment variable for setting and overriding the key used when authenticating against the API
* Generate a single key for all organization repositories when authenticating a new user
* Return a non-zero exit code from `hex.outdated` when dependencies are outdated
* Generate two API keys when authenticating, one encrypted with write access, and one unencrypted with only read access
* Add ownership levels to `hex.owner` task
* When resolving, try all possible backtrack branches and select the best solution
* Improve formatting of multi-line validation errors
* Do not use `:maintainers` package configuration field
* Change `hex.organization` to generate keys owned by organization instead of the user generating them
* Add options to `hex.organization key` for revoking and listing keys owned by organization
* Improve interface for `hex.user key` and `hex.organization key`, the following commands have changed:
  * `hex.user key --generate` => `hex.user key generate`
  * `hex.user key --list` => `hex.user key list`
  * `hex.user key --revoke KEY_NAME` => `hex.user key revoke KEY_NAME`
  * `hex.user key --revoke-all` => `hex.user key revoke --all`

## v0.17.0 (2017-08-28)

### Private packages and organizations

Hex.pm is adding support for private packages with organizations. See https://hex.pm/docs/private for more details. To authorize an organization on your machine run `mix hex.organization auth acme`, this will store the organization's repository details in Hex so that you can fetch packages from the repository. As soon as you are added as a member to an organization you can administer and publish packages, if you have the appropriate role, with the `--organization` flag or by setting the `:organization` option on the package configuration.

Different from the last release packages will always be pulled from the default `hexpm` repository and you have to override it with the `:organization` or `:repo` options on the dependency configuration.

* Add `hex.organization` task
* Rename `hex.user key` flag `--remove*` to `--revoke*` to clarify what it does

## v0.16.0 (2017-04-18)

### Multiple repository support

This version adds support for using packages from multiple repositories. With the `hex.repo` task additional repositories can be added to Hex. With it you can add additional repositories or replace the default "hexpm" repository by running `mix hex.repo add hexpm ...`, check the docs for more information. To use a dependency from another repository add `repo: :my_other_repo` to the dependency definition in `mix.exs` and make sure you have added `my_other_repo` with `mix hex.repo add my_other_repo`. Dependencies of a package will be automatically pulled from the same repository as the parent package unless otherwise stated with the `:repo` option on the dependency definition.

### Enhancements

* Add `hex.repo` task
* Move `hex.key` tasks to `hex.user keys`
* Warn or error if publishing a package with pre-release dependencies

## v0.15.0 (2016-12-24)

### Package retirement

With this new release you can mark versions of your packages as retired when you no longer recommend its use. This can be because the release has a serious security flaw, something went wrong with the release so that it's unusable or because the package has been renamed or deprecated. A retired version is still usable and fetchable but it will show as retired on hex.pm and when resolved Hex will show a warning to the user with the retirement message.

### Enhancements

* Add --module flag to `hex.docs` task
* Changed `hex.outdated` task to show if a dependency can be updated

* Limit concurrent registry HTTP requests

## v0.14.0 (2016-10-28)

### New registry format

Hex has switched to a new registry format that is more efficient and will scale better as the registry grows. The new registry format is encoded with protocol buffers and is split into multiple files (one file per package) to avoid fetching one big file with data you will not need. The resolver will make more HTTP requests but will in total fetch much less data. The specification for the new format can be found here: https://github.com/hexpm/specifications/pull/10. The old ETS based registry format is no longer supported in the client but will continue to be available from the registry for the foreseeable future.

### Enhancements

* `hex.docs open` will by default open the online hexdocs for the given package
* An `--offline` option has been added to `hex.docs open` for opening docs stored on your local filesystem and it will automatically fetch the docs if they are not available locally
