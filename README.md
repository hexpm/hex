# Hex

[![CI](https://github.com/hexpm/hex/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hexpm/hex/actions)

Hex is a package manager for the Erlang ecosystem.

This project currently provides tasks that integrate with Mix, [Elixir](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir)'s build tool.

See [hex.pm](https://hex.pm) for installation instructions and other documentation.

## Contributing

Install Hex locally for development with: `mix install`.

### Bundled CA certs

Hex bundles a list of root CA certificates used for certificate validation in HTTPS. The certificates are fetched from [Mozilla's source tree](http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-release/raw-file/default/security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt) with curl's [mk-ca-bundle.pl](https://github.com/bagder/curl/blob/master/lib/mk-ca-bundle.pl) script. The bundle created from the Perl script is stored in `lib/hex/http/ca-bundle.crt` and is included in source control, the file should be updated when new releases are made by Mozilla. When Hex is compiled the certificates are parsed and included with the compiled artifacts. The task `mix certdata` automates this process.

### hexpm

Integration tests run against the API server [hexpm](https://github.com/hexpm/hexpm). It needs to be cloned into `../hexpm` or `HEXPM_PATH` needs to be set and point its location. hexpm also requires postgresql with username `postgres` and password `postgres`.

Exclude integration tests with `mix test --exclude integration`.
